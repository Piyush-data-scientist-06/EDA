## Computer Science Department  CS675 – Introduction to Data Science (CRN: 22531) Spring 2023

## Project #1 / Due 24-Feb-2023
1. The goal of this assignment is to understand the logic and methods of exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
2. The mode of analysis concerned with discovery, exploration, and empirically detecting phenomena in data. EDA has become the default pre-modeling step for every Machine Learning project engagement. 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a way to investigate datasets and find preliminary information, insights, or uncover underlying patterns in the data. Instead of making assumptions, data can be processed in a systematic method to gain insights and make informed decisions. 
4. Investigate the data by utilizing NumPy, Pandas, any graph library (MatPlotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), and Python’s Statsmodel modules. 
5. The analysis of the data should be focus on predicting the progression of a disease (diabetes in our case). 
6. Get the data from Stanford U’s Machine Learning Repository:
https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/LARS/diabetes.data
7. Implement a Linear Regression algorithm (model) in Python, by using the Scikit-learn module. 
8. The regression model should be able to predict the progression of a disease (diabetes in our case) by using the least-squares regression
